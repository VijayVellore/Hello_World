• 4. Create the compare and compile info into a summary slid","rNPS spike post repair may be due to down time during node repair and survey coming in closely behind down time
• Based on Freedoms rNPS compared to NED rNPS, if a program were to affect rNPS it would be visible and improvement should be able to be tracked easily
• Access to more PRP nodes would increase chance of surveys for PRP type as rNPS surveys are randomly, and can not be sent to just PRP node types

Data pulled from Netezza and cross-checked from NCO database (source) all months match expect February which 
has a 1% variance due to Warm Transfer flag being added to database

NEXT STEPS
•Divisional and Regional (customer impact), Call Center (Operational Impact) distribution •Break out by queue to determine transfer rates by queue AND tie to tNPS and rNPS. •Determine % of cold transfers where a warm transfer was attempted but not achieved due to SLA/SLs.  If a 
significant % of the cold transfers had an attempted warm transfer, this would be a good use case to push those customers to virtual hold and improve service levels (assuming cold transfers are part of the service level calculation",Customer Service,Customer Service,CXA,Bryan Kelly,Bryan Kelly,Bryan Kelly,Bryan Kelly,Bryan Kelly,Bryan Kelly,,https://comcast.app.box.com/files/0/f/7000257613/US653371_warm-cold-no_transfer_calls,16-03-2016,,"Warm Transfer, Cold Transfer, Not Transferred,TNPS, rNPS, Percentage of cold transfers, Percentage of warm transfers, SLA's ",US653371,,,

Generally speaking, for customers with lower NPS and no issues, they do have a higher call in rate for billing (approximately by 4%). 

For customers with lower NPS(Detractor) and no issues, the Billing Call rate is higher.
